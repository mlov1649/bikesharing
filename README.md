Summary
From the visualizations we can see that the most active users are male commuters who likely ride to work in the morning and return to the neighborhoods right after. A shockingly high number of rides last only 6 minutes. For a bikeshare service to be useful for these riders, itâ€™s critical to make the checkout process fast. 

Tourism might be an area for growth. A visualization that filters weekend activity amongst non-subscribers can be used to indicate what types of attractions pairs with bikesharing the most. 

Another visualization can be created that illustrates the start and end locations as vectors.  


In addition to those visualizations using the current dataset, some research can be done to investigate the lack of ridership on Wednesdays. Do commuters take a break on Wednesday? Was there a a storm on a Wednesday in the August 2019?
